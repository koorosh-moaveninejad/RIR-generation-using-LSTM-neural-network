Conventional methods for obtaining the Room Impulse Response (RIR) and acquiring  
acoustic information about an environment typically involve transmitting a known signal  
from an audio source, allowing it to propagate through the space, and then capturing it  
at a specific location.  

By dividing the received signal by the transmitted signal in the frequency domain,  
the transfer function of the environment can be extracted.  

However, this traditional approach is computationally intensive and introduces  
considerable delay, making it unsuitable for real-time systems.  

This project aims to develop a fast method for estimating the RIR based on the  
listenerâ€™s position within the environment using machine learning. 

In this project, VAE and LSTM neural networks are combined to get a sufficient 
performance.
